This is a semi-automatic script. We should manually switch between different machines, following the note of each block.

The first part of srcipt is quick run of the code in writeup. At line 46, we should manually add its key into user's authorized_keys so that different VMs can communicate with each other without inputing password.

Then, we combine the command to set up yarn. We should adjust the permission of file maybe.

Also, we add all the hosts into known_keys and distribute it to all the VMs.

After that, we can run the replayTrace.py. 

Finally, goto the tetris file and the follow the README here to finish this phase.

Compared to first phase, we need to change the racks' number. Then we add some chmod to add authorization to my userid.
